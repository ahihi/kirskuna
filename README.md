Aims to become a stand-alone synth/FX performance system, designed for the Raspberry Pi with [touch screen](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-touch-display/) and [audio injector](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1250664710/audio-injector-sound-card-for-the-raspberry-pi), but compatible with anything that has PortAudio and OpenGL support.
